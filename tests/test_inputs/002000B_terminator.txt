The Terminator is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah.

In the near future, the Artificial Intelligence defense network Skynet becomes self-aware and initiates a nuclear holocaust to destroy humanity. Years later, the human resistance, led by John Connor, is on the verge of victory. Skynet sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The Resistance sends Kyle Reese to stop it.

The Terminator arrives in 1984 Los Angeles and begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor. Reese arrives shortly after and intercepts the Terminator as it attacks the real Sarah Connor in a nightclub. They escape, and Reese explains the future war to a skeptical Sarah.

The Terminator pursues them relentlessly, displaying superhuman strength and resilience. Sarah and Reese bond as they evade the cyborg. Reese reveals that he volunteered for the mission because he had fallen in love with Sarah from a photograph given to him by John.

In a final confrontation in a factory, Reese sacrifices himself to blow up the Terminator, destroying its outer sheath but leaving its metal endoskeleton functioning. The crippled Terminator pursues Sarah into a hydraulic press, where she finally crushes and destroys it. A pregnant Sarah travels to Mexico, recording audio tapes for her unborn son, John, preparing for the coming storm.
