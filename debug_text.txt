 Provide filtering capabilities so users could explore and narrow down the building codes based on the extracted
logic.
• Demonstrate the power of graph traversal, enabling users to navigate between interconnected sections of the
building code seamlessly.
Challenges and Future Work
Although this beginning phase of the project had great progess, several challenges and areas for improvement were
identified during the process. Addressing these issues will ensure greater accuracy and efficiency in the future. Below
are key difficulties encountered with proposed solutions, and discussion on future work.

Challenges
1. Data Chunk Extraction from the BCBCOne of the major challenges was accurately extracting correct
chucks of data (blocks of codes) from the BCBC, particularly when codes spanned multiple pages. PDF extraction
can be problematic due to inconsistencies in formatting, where sections or tables break across pages, making it
difficult to capture these in a unified format. This was p

 the GPT-4 API into automated pipelines, the team could parse large volumes of
content with minimal manual intervention.
Overall, this transition significantly boosted both the speed and accuracy of capturing the BCBC’s intricate legal
text and complex logical structure.
3. Integration with Neo4j
Once large sections of the BCBC were digitized and its logic extracted, the data was ingested into a Neo4j graph
database. Neo4j was chosen for its ability to represent complex relationships in a graph structure, allowing the
BCBC’s logical connections to be stored and queried in an intuitive manner. This phase involved writing an ingestion
script that utilizes Neo4j’s declarative quary language, Cyphers, to embed the BCBC as a graph:
• Nodes: Each building code element is embedded as a node, which has properties to hold the type (article,
sentence, table, etc.) and descriptions (code text).
• Hierarchy: The structural hierarchy is represented by directed edges named CONTAINS. For example, a

Summary
The aim of this project is to digitize the British Columbia Building Code (BCBC) to improve its accessibility,
usability, and efficiency for architects, engineers, and other professionals. By leveraging large language models and
graph database technology, the project explored the feasibility of transforming the complex, lengthy BCBC document
into a machine-readable format, capturing both its structural hierarchy and logical relationships. Integrating a graph
database (Neo4j) enabled the visualization and traversal of these relationships, while a front-end demo showcased
the potential for interactive navigation and filtering. This first phase lays the groundwork for modernizing how
professionals interact with building codes, offering a more streamlined and user-friendly approach to compliance and
design.
Project Overview
This project has fou

ances where
the model failed to correctly identify the logical connectives (OR, AND, NOT) between codes. This was most
apparent with codes requiring a list of lower level codes (clauses, subclauses) to be satisfied. The logical connectives
connecting these lower level codes were occasionally misinterpreted; AND instead of OR, and vise versa.
Solution: A three-step improvement process is proposed:
1. Breaking Down Logic Extraction:First, breaking down the task of logic extraction into smaller, more
manageable components would break the logic into parts (to be concatenated at a later stage) and shorten
the length of prompts. This could allow the model to focus on less complicated logic structures, improving
accuracy.
2. Fine-Tuning the Model:Second, fine-tuning the GPT model on a dataset of building code-specific logic
would further enhance the accuracy of extractions, as it would learn the particular nuances of the BCBC’s
logical structure.
3. Tuning the Temperature Parameter:The third

e particular nuances of the BCBC’s
logical structure.
3. Tuning the Temperature Parameter:The third improvement involves adjusting the temperature parameter
during the logic extraction process. The temperature setting in GPT models controls the randomness of
the output: a higher temperature (e.g., 0.8-1.0) generates more creative and varied responses, while a lower
temperature (e.g., 0.2-0.4) leads to more deterministic and focused output. For logic extraction, lowering the
temperature could help the model focus on producing consistent, well-defined logical structures rather than
introducing variability. Fine-tuning this parameter for the specific task of extracting building code logic will
likely result in more accurate and reliable results.
4. Algorithm Accuracy Measurement Given the size of the BCBC, which spans over 1800 pages, calculating
the overall accuracy of the extraction algorithm remains a complex and unresolved issue. Without a clear benchmark
