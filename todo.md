# TODO

- [ ] Ask agent to
  - [x] Change settings so I can use local ollama with antigravity (currently not possible)
  - [ ] Write a nice summary of how the subsystems are tested
  - [ ] draw a system architecture diagram containing the major subsystems like ACE
  - [ ] Fix the python language server settings so it stops crashing (installing a different one is ok)
- [x] Ask agent about including "Knowledge" artifacts: mirrors "learnings" or "lessons learned" in current framework? (currently does not seem to be supported, support ticket filed)

- [ ] there's a bug that causes the screen to flash white when the page is reloaded. there should be no flash for either light or dark mode (this issue might already be in beads. If so, it just needs the additional information upserted into it.
