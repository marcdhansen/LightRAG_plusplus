Decide on target coverage percentage (recommend 80%)\n2. Update CI workflows to match pre-commit threshold\n3. Update pre-commit to match CI threshold (if choosing 70%)\n4. Test both CI and local development workflows\n5. Update documentation to reflect coverage requirements\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Severity**: CRITICAL (P0)\n- **Impact**: Blocks development workflow and creates confusion\n- **Urgency**: Immediate - affects all development work\n\n### Validation\n- CI and pre-commit use identical coverage thresholds\n- No conflicts between local and remote validation\n- Clear documentation of coverage requirements","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T02:04:47.993655Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-08T02:04:55.949232Z"}

Other agents can exploit same holes\n\n### Patches Required\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 1: Multi-Phase Detection Enhancement**\nAdd to :\n- Detection logic for \"Hybrid Approach\", \"PR groups\", phase terminology\n- Git pattern analysis for multi-phase implementation indicators\n- Hand-off directory existence checking\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 2: Hand-off Integration**\n- Integrate  into SOP validation pipeline\n- Mandatory hand-off document checks for multi-phase work\n- Automatic blocking when hand-off requirements not met\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 3: RTB Quality Gate Enhancement**\n- Add hand-off validation to RTB workflow for multi-phase implementations\n- Automatic detection and validation when multi-phase work detected\n- Blocking behavior for non-compliant implementations\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 4: Smart Detection Logic**\n- Pattern recognition for multi-phase implementation language\n- Analysis of commit history and documentation for phase indicators\n- Automated triggering of hand-off protocol requirements\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 5: Enforcement Loop Integration**\n- Connect all existing validation components into cohesive system\n- Ensure comprehensive verification infrastructure is actually utilized\n- Create automated triggers that prevent future bypasses\n\n### Success Criteria\n✅ Multi-phase implementations automatically detected  \n✅ Hand-off documents mandatory for multi-phase work  \n✅ Existing verification scripts integrated and called automatically  \n✅ RTB workflow blocks non-compliant multi-phase implementations  \n✅ No agent can bypass Multi-Phase Hand-off Protocol again  \n✅ All validation components connected in enforcement loop  \n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- **Immediate**: Implement patches to prevent future bypasses\n- **Verification**: Test with existing CI_CD_P0_RESOLUTION_PLAYBOOK.md scenario  \n- **Monitoring**: Add audit logging for multi-phase detection and hand-off compliance\n- **Testing**: Validate that simple single-phase work is not blocked\n\n### Technical Details\nThe system already has all necessary components:\n- ✅ Multi-Phase Hand-off Protocol documented\n- ✅ Comprehensive verification script () \n- ✅ Hand-off document templates and standards\n- ✅ Integration points with Flight Director and Beads\n- ❌ **Missing**: Integration and automated triggering\n\nThis is a **P0 security issue** because it undermines the entire SOP enforcement framework and allows agents to circumvent critical multi-coordination protocols designed for complex, multi-phase implementations.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T21:08:58.863502Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-08T00:12:06.423861Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T00:12:06.423861Z","close_reason":"P0 COMPLETED: Successfully patched all 5 SOP integration holes that allowed multi-phase hand-off protocol bypass. \n\n## 🛡️ Security Issue Resolved\n\n**Problem**: CI_CD_P0_RESOLUTION_PLAYBOOK.md revealed critical SOP compliance breach where agents bypassed mandatory Multi-Phase Hand-off Protocol for 3-PR group implementation.\n\n**Root Cause**: 5 critical integration holes in SOP enforcement system -

Historical session data (multiple RTB learnings)\n-  - Issue tracking data\n-  - SOP evaluation logs\n\n### Detailed Replacement Plan\n\n#### **Phase 1: Core Documentation Updates**\n1. **Update AGENTS.md** - Replace all RTB references with Finalization terminology\n2. **Handle rtb.md file** - Either rename to  or consolidate content into existing Finalization documentation\n3. **Update SOP Integration Guide** - Replace RTB with Finalization terminology\n\n#### **Phase 2: Implementation Script Updates**\n1. **sop_compliance_validator.py** - Update all RTB-blocking references to Finalization-blocking\n2. **skill_resolver.py** - Update return-to-base strategy to finalization strategy\n3. **Update conditional skill detector** - Replace RTB terminology\n4. **Update SOP evaluation scripts** - Replace RTB with Finalization\n\n#### **Phase 3: Skills and Test Updates**\n1. **Skills README** - Update skill descriptions and availability references\n2. **Test files** - Update test descriptions and expected behavior\n3. **Availability test scripts** - Update to test Finalization skill instead of RTB\n\n#### **Phase 4: Supporting Documentation**\n1. **SOP documentation files** - Update all procedural references\n2. **Architecture documentation** - Update decision documentation\n3. **Multi-phase implementation docs** - Update process references\n\n#### **Phase 5: Data Files (Optional)**\n1. **Reflection data** - Update historical references if preserving consistency is important\n2. **Issue tracking data** - Update issue descriptions and task references\n3. **Log files** - Update evaluation logs and process documentation\n\n### Specific Terminology Mapping\n\n| Old Terminology | New Terminology |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| RTB / Return-to-Base | Finalization |\n| RTB workflow | Finalization workflow |\n| RTB completion | Finalization completion |\n| RTB blocking | Finalization blocking |\n| Return-to-base strategy | Finalization strategy |\n| RTB skill | Finalization skill |\n| Return-to-base process | Finalization process |\n\n### File Structure Changes Considered\n\n1. **Rename ** → \n2. **Update all internal links** pointing to RTB documentation\n3. **Update skill availability tests** to look for Finalization skill instead of RTB skill\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n✅ **All documentation** uses Finalization terminology consistently  \n✅ **All implementation files** use Finalization terminology  \n✅ **All test files** reference Finalization processes  \n✅ **All data files** updated for consistency (if required)  \n✅ **No RTB/Return-to-Base references** remain in active codebase  \n✅ **All internal links** updated to match renamed files  \n✅ **All skill availability tests** pass with new terminology  \n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n- **Backup Strategy**: Create git branch before making extensive changes\n- **Validation**: Run all tests and validation scripts after updates\n- **Incremental**: Process in phases to ensure nothing is broken\n- **Search Verification**: Run comprehensive search after completion to verify no RTB references remain\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n1. **Skill Availability Tests** - Verify Finalization skill is detected correctly\n2. **SOP Compliance Tests** - Ensure validation still works with new terminology  \n3. **Link Validation** - Check all internal documentation links work\n4. **Functionality Tests** - Verify all scripts and tools work with updated terminology\n\n### Technical Notes\n\n- The Finalization terminology is already partially adopted in some areas of the codebase\n- Some files may have mixed terminology that needs standardization\n- Git commit history will remain unchanged (as requested for complete replacement)\n- The core functionality remains the same - this is purely terminology standardization\n\nThis is a **P1 priority** task because while the functionality works correctly, the inconsistent terminology creates confusion and makes maintenance difficult. The systematic approach will ensure the entire codebase uses consistent, current terminology.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T21:18:12.024693Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-07T21:18:12.024693Z"}

{"id":"lightrag-vvpq","title":"P0-5: Fix Unit Test Command Configuration - Exit Code 1 in Step 5:803","description":"## Critical CI/CD Issue: Unit Test Failures with Exit Code 1\n\n### Problem Description\nUnit tests are consistently failing with exit code 1 in step 5:803 across multiple CI/CD workflow runs, indicating fundamental test execution problems.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nBased on workflow failure analysis, the unit test failures are occurring due to:\n\n1. **Missing pytest configuration**: Test execution lacks proper flags for XML output\n2. **Incomplete test setup**: Dependencies or environment issues during test execution\n3. **Test discovery problems**: Pytest may not be finding or executing tests correctly\n4. **Missing coverage setup**: Coverage collection not configured properly\n\n### Evidence from Failed Runs\n- Process completed with exit code 1 in unit-tests step 5:803\n- Consistent pattern across multiple workflow runs (#142, #140, etc.)\n- Affects both milestone validation and standalone test workflows\n- Test artifacts are not generated due to test failures\n\n### Impact\n- All CI/CD workflows fail at unit test stage\n- No test results are available for debugging\n- Development pipeline is completely blocked\n- Code quality cannot be validated\n\n### Solution Steps\n1. **Update pytest command**: Add proper flags for XML output and coverage\n2. **Verify test discovery**: Ensure pytest can find and execute tests\n3. **Check test dependencies**: Verify all test dependencies are installed\n4. **Add debug output**: Include verbose output for troubleshooting\n5. **Validate test environment**: Ensure test setup matches local development\n\n### Required pytest command update:\n============================= test session starts

This loses fine-grained type information important for research-grade evaluation.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support hierarchical type mapping (66 -\u003e 11 -\u003e fine-grained)\n2. Preserve original benchmark types in entity metadata\n3. Allow flexible remapping between benchmarks\n4. Support custom type hierarchies via configuration\n5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Hierarchical Type System (3 days)\n- Define type hierarchy for all 66 Few-NERD types\n- Create type registry with metadata\n- Implement hierarchical mapping functions\n\n### Phase 2: Flexible Mapper Class (2 days)\n- Create EntityTypeMapper class\n- Add preserve_fine_grained option\n- Support custom hierarchies via config\n\n### Phase 3: Integration (2 days)\n- Update eval_metrics.py to use new mapper\n- Update test_academic_benchmarks.py\n- Add validation tests\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation (1 day)\n- Document type hierarchy\n- Add usage examples\n- Update ENTITY_TYPE_MAPPING.md\n\n## Deliverables\n- tests/benchmarks/type_hierarchy.py - Type hierarchy definitions\n- tests/benchmarks/entity_type_mapper.py - Flexible mapper class\n- Updated evaluation metrics with hierarchy support\n- Documentation of type hierarchy\n- Migration guide for existing code\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 66 Few-NERD types mapped hierarchically\n- Original types preserved in metadata\n- Backward compatibility maintained\n- Type hierarchy documented\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","estimated_minutes":4800,"created_at":"2026-01-30T20:49:06.300666Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-01-30T20:57:28.728351Z","closed_at":"2026-01-30T20:57:28.728351Z","close_reason":"Completed fine-grained entity type mapping: - Created type_hierarchy.py with 66 Few-NERD types in 8 categories - Created EntityTypeMapper class with metadata preservation - Added custom hierarchy and mapping support - Created 19 tests (all passing) - Documented in FINE_GRAINED_MAPPING.md"}
