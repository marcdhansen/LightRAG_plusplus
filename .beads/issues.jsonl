{"id":"lightrag-ixi0","title":"P0: Fix PR #49 dependency resolution failures blocking merge","description":"## 🚨 CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION FIXES NEEDED\n\n### Problem Description\nPR #49 (P0: Critical CI/CD infrastructure fixes and security patches) is **BLOCKED FROM MERGE** due to dependency resolution failures in CI. The unit-tests job fails with \"resolution-too-deep\" error before any tests run.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nBased on CI failure logs analysis:\n- **Primary Error**:  - Pip cannot resolve complex dependency graph\n- **Contributing Issues**: Overly broad version ranges causing excessive dependency tree complexity\n- **Impact**: CI fails at dependency installation stage, blocking all infrastructure fixes\n\n### Specific Issues Found\n\n#### 1. **Problematic Dependencies in pyproject.toml**\n-  (no upper bound, tries many versions)\n-  (no upper bound, excessive version attempts)\n- Multiple packages with loose version constraints\n\n#### 2. **Package Name Inconsistency**\n- Line 139: References  (old package name)\n- Line 143: References  (old package name)\n- Line 157: References  (old package name)\n- Line 164: References  (old package name)\n\n#### 3. **Complex Dependency Graph**\n- 50+ dependencies with overlapping version ranges\n- Optional dependencies creating circular resolution paths\n- Missing specific version bounds for stability\n\n### Required Fixes\n\n#### **Phase 1: Dependency Constraint Fixes (P0)**\n1. **Add upper bounds** to problematic dependencies:\n   - \n   - \n   - Similar bounds for other loose dependencies\n\n2. **Fix package name references**:\n   - Replace all  with \n   - Ensure consistency across optional dependencies\n\n3. **Simplify dependency tree**:\n   - Remove redundant dependencies\n   - Consolidate overlapping version ranges\n\n#### **Phase 2: Validation \u0026 Testing (P0)**\n1. **Test

SOP enforcement is ineffective\n- **Risk**: Critical - Complex implementations can bypass required procedures\n- **Compliance**: Failed - Mandatory protocol was circumvented\n- **Future Risk**: Systemic - Other agents can exploit same holes\n\n### Patches Required\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 1: Multi-Phase Detection Enhancement**\nAdd to :\n- Detection logic for \"Hybrid Approach\", \"PR groups\", phase terminology\n- Git pattern analysis for multi-phase implementation indicators\n- Hand-off directory existence checking\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 2: Hand-off Integration**\n- Integrate  into SOP validation pipeline\n- Mandatory hand-off document checks for multi-phase work\n- Automatic blocking when hand-off requirements not met\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 3: RTB Quality Gate Enhancement**\n- Add hand-off validation to RTB workflow for multi-phase implementations\n- Automatic detection and validation when multi-phase work detected\n- Blocking behavior for non-compliant implementations\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 4: Smart Detection Logic**\n- Pattern recognition for multi-phase implementation language\n- Analysis of commit history and documentation for phase indicators\n- Automated triggering of hand-off protocol requirements\n\n#### 🛠️ **Patch 5: Enforcement Loop Integration**\n- Connect all existing validation components into cohesive system\n- Ensure comprehensive verification infrastructure is actually utilized\n- Create automated triggers that prevent future bypasses\n\n### Success Criteria\n✅ Multi-phase implementations automatically detected  \n✅ Hand-off documents mandatory for multi-phase work  \n✅ Existing verification scripts integrated and called automatically  \n✅ RTB workflow blocks non-compliant multi-phase implementations  \n✅ No agent can bypass Multi-Phase Hand-off Protocol again  \n✅ All validation components connected in enforcement loop  \n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- **Immediate**: Implement patches to prevent future bypasses\n- **Verification**: Test with existing CI_CD_P0_RESOLUTION_PLAYBOOK.md scenario  \n- **Monitoring**: Add audit logging for multi-phase detection and hand-off compliance\n- **Testing**: Validate that simple single-phase work is not blocked\n\n### Technical Details\nThe system already has all necessary components:\n- ✅ Multi-Phase Hand-off Protocol documented\n- ✅ Comprehensive verification script () \n- ✅ Hand-off document templates and standards\n- ✅ Integration points with Flight Director and Beads\n- ❌ **Missing**: Integration and automated triggering\n\nThis is a **P0 security issue** because it undermines the entire SOP enforcement framework and allows agents to circumvent critical multi-coordination protocols designed for complex, multi-phase implementations.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T21:08:58.863502Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-08T00:12:06.423861Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T00:12:06.423861Z","close_reason":"P0 COMPLETED: Successfully patched all 5 SOP integration holes that allowed multi-phase hand-off protocol bypass. \n\n## 🛡️ Security Issue Resolved\n\n**Problem**: CI_CD_P0_RESOLUTION_PLAYBOOK.md revealed critical SOP compliance breach where agents bypassed mandatory Multi-Phase Hand-off Protocol for 3-PR group implementation.\n\n**Root Cause**: 5 critical integration holes in SOP enforcement system -

No Automated Issue Creation: CI failures on PRs don't automatically create tracking issues\n2. Silent Failures: PRs can fail without proper notification or tracking\n3. Manual Overhead: Developers must manually create issues for CI failures\n4. Lost Visibility: Team has no centralized view of CI failure patterns\n5. Slower Resolution: Without automated issues, failures take longer to address\n\n### Root Cause\nThe workflow_run trigger only works on the default branch, making the current approach ineffective for PR-based development.\n\n### Files Affected\n- .github/workflows/ci-failure-handler.yml - Currently disabled and limited\n\n### Solution Options\nOption A: Enable PR-Friendly Failure Handler (Recommended)\n- Add failure handling directly to individual workflows\n- Use inline issue creation in each workflow\n- Ensure PR-specific context and notifications\n\nOption B: Multi-Trigger Approach\n- Keep workflow_run for default branch\n- Add pull_request triggers for direct PR handling\n- Implement dual-path failure handling\n\n### Solution Steps\n1. Enable automated failure handling for PR workflows\n2. Add issue creation with proper PR context\n3. Include diagnostic information in failure reports\n4. Test failure handling on both PRs and pushes\n5. Verify integration with existing notification systems\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Severity: CRITICAL (P0)\n- Impact: Loss of automated failure detection and tracking\n- Urgency: Immediate - affects all PR validation and team visibility\n\n### Validation\n- PR failures automatically create detailed GitHub issues\n- Issues include relevant diagnostic information\n- Team receives proper notifications for failures\n- No silent failures in the CI/CD pipeline","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T02:05:07.392589Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-12T15:10:41.708947Z","closed_at":"2026-02-12T15:10:41.708947Z","close_reason":"RESOLVED: Enhanced CI/CD failure handler for Pull Request support\n\n## Issue\nCI failure handler disabled and only works on default branch, not on PRs where most failures occur\n\n## Solution Implemented\n1. **Enabled PR Support**: Added pull_request triggers for opened, synchronized, reopened events\n2. **Enhanced Event Detection**: Workflow now works on both pushes and PRs  \n3. **Improved Context Extraction**: Added PR-specific context (number, title, author, branches)\n4. **Better Issue Creation**: Enhanced issue body with PR context and diagnostic information\n5. **Proper Triggers**: workflow_run, push, and pull_request triggers all active\n6. **Maintains Manual Testing**: Kept workflow_dispatch for debugging and testing\n\n## Technical Changes\n- .github/workflows/ci-failure-handler.yml:\n  - Added pull_request triggers with proper event types\n  - Enhanced job condition to handle multiple event types\n  - Improved environment variable extraction for different GitHub events\n  - Added PR context extraction (number, title, author, base/head branches)\n  - Maintained compatibility with existing diagnostic script\n\n## Validation\n✅ PR failures will now automatically create tracking issues\n✅ Issues include full PR context for better debugging\n✅ Works on both default branch and Pull Requests\n✅ Maintains manual testing capability via workflow_dispatch\n✅ No more silent CI failures on development workflow\n\n## Impact\n- Automated failure detection and tracking now works for Pull Request development\n- Development team gets proper notifications for CI/CD issues\n- Issues include diagnostic information for faster resolution\n- Silent failures eliminated - all CI problems now tracked\n\nCI/CD pipeline now fully supports modern development workflow with proper failure handling and issue tracking."}

Replace RTB with Finalization terminology\n\n#### **Phase 2: Implementation Script Updates**\n1. **sop_compliance_validator.py** - Update all RTB-blocking references to Finalization-blocking\n2. **skill_resolver.py** - Update return-to-base strategy to finalization strategy\n3. **Update conditional skill detector** - Replace RTB terminology\n4. **Update SOP evaluation scripts** - Replace RTB with Finalization\n\n#### **Phase 3: Skills and Test Updates**\n1. **Skills README** - Update skill descriptions and availability references\n2. **Test files** - Update test descriptions and expected behavior\n3. **Availability test scripts** - Update to test Finalization skill instead of RTB\n\n#### **Phase 4: Supporting Documentation**\n1. **SOP documentation files** - Update all procedural references\n2. **Architecture documentation** - Update decision documentation\n3. **Multi-phase implementation docs** - Update process references\n\n#### **Phase 5: Data Files (Optional)**\n1. **Reflection data** - Update historical references if preserving consistency is important\n2. **Issue tracking data** - Update issue descriptions and task references\n3. **Log files** - Update evaluation logs and process documentation\n\n### Specific Terminology Mapping\n\n| Old Terminology | New Terminology |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| RTB / Return-to-Base | Finalization |\n| RTB workflow | Finalization workflow |\n| RTB completion | Finalization completion |\n| RTB blocking | Finalization blocking |\n| Return-to-base strategy | Finalization strategy |\n| RTB skill | Finalization skill |\n| Return-to-base process | Finalization process |\n\n### File Structure Changes Considered\n\n1. **Rename ** → \n2. **Update all internal links** pointing to RTB documentation\n3. **Update skill availability tests** to look for Finalization skill instead of RTB skill\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n✅ **All documentation** uses Finalization terminology consistently  \n✅ **All implementation files** use Finalization terminology  \n✅ **All test files** reference Finalization processes  \n✅ **All data files** updated for consistency (if required)  \n✅ **No RTB/Return-to-Base references** remain in active codebase  \n✅ **All internal links** updated to match renamed files  \n✅ **All skill availability tests** pass with new terminology  \n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n- **Backup Strategy**: Create git branch before making extensive changes\n- **Validation**: Run all tests and validation scripts after updates\n- **Incremental**: Process in phases to ensure nothing is broken\n- **Search Verification**: Run comprehensive search after completion to verify no RTB references remain\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n1. **Skill Availability Tests** - Verify Finalization skill is detected correctly\n2. **SOP Compliance Tests** - Ensure validation still works with new terminology  \n3. **Link Validation** - Check all internal documentation links work\n4. **Functionality Tests** - Verify all scripts and tools work with updated terminology\n\n### Technical Notes\n\n- The Finalization terminology is already partially adopted in some areas of the codebase\n- Some files may have mixed terminology that needs standardization\n- Git commit history will remain unchanged (as requested for complete replacement)\n- The core functionality remains the same - this is purely terminology standardization\n\nThis is a **P1 priority** task because while the functionality works correctly, the inconsistent terminology creates confusion and makes maintenance difficult. The systematic approach will ensure the entire codebase uses consistent, current terminology.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T21:18:12.024693Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-07T21:18:12.024693Z"}

{"id":"lightrag-vvpq","title":"P0-5: Fix Unit Test Command Configuration - Exit Code 1 in Step 5:803","description":"## Critical CI/CD Issue: Unit Test Failures with Exit Code 1\n\n### Problem Description\nUnit tests are consistently failing with exit code 1 in step 5:803 across multiple CI/CD workflow runs, indicating fundamental test execution problems.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nBased on workflow failure analysis, the unit test failures are occurring due to:\n\n1. **Missing pytest configuration**: Test execution lacks proper flags for XML output\n2. **Incomplete test setup**: Dependencies or environment issues during test execution\n3. **Test discovery problems**: Pytest may not be finding or executing tests correctly\n4. **Missing coverage setup**: Coverage collection not configured properly\n\n### Evidence from Failed Runs\n- Process completed with exit code 1 in unit-tests step 5:803\n- Consistent pattern across multiple workflow runs (#142, #140, etc.)\n- Affects both milestone validation and standalone test workflows\n- Test artifacts are not generated due to test failures\n\n### Impact\n- All CI/CD workflows fail at unit test stage\n- No test results are available for debugging\n- Development pipeline is completely blocked\n- Code quality cannot be validated\n\n### Solution Steps\n1. **Update pytest command**: Add proper flags for XML output and coverage\n2. **Verify test discovery**: Ensure pytest can find and execute tests\n3. **Check test dependencies**: Verify all test dependencies are installed\n4. **Add debug output**: Include verbose output for troubleshooting\n5. **Validate test environment**: Ensure test setup matches local development\n\n### Required pytest command update:\n============================= test session starts

Need reliable coverage measurement to track progress toward 80% target.\n\n**Current Issues:**\n- pytest-cov fails on import due to torch compatibility issues\n- No centralized coverage reporting dashboard\n- Manual coverage calculations are time-consuming\n- Coverage gaps are not systematically identified\n- No historical coverage tracking\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Fix coverage measurement infrastructure:\n   - Resolve torch import conflicts in coverage measurement\n   - Ensure pytest-cov works reliably with entire codebase\n   - Add coverage configuration exclusions for problematic imports\n\n2. Create comprehensive coverage reporting:\n   - Automated coverage reports for each test run\n   - Coverage trend tracking over time\n   - Module-by-module coverage breakdown\n   - Coverage gap identification and prioritization\n\n3. Add coverage quality gates:\n   - Minimum coverage thresholds for PR validation\n   - Coverage regression detection\n   - Automated coverage trend analysis\n   - Integration with CI/CD pipeline\n\n4. Implement coverage analysis tools:\n   - Identify untested code paths\n   - Prioritize coverage improvements by impact\n   - Track coverage vs code complexity metrics\n   - Generate coverage improvement recommendations\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Coverage measurement works without torch import failures\n- [ ] Comprehensive coverage reports generated automatically\n- [ ] Coverage trends are tracked and visualized\n- [ ] Coverage gates prevent regressions\n- [ ] Coverage gaps are systematically identified and prioritized\n- [ ] Integration tests are included in coverage measurement\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- None (infrastructure improvement)\n\n**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days\n**Risk Level:** LOW - Tooling and infrastructure only\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Support for both pytest-cov and manual coverage calculation\n- HTML and JSON report generation\n- Coverage data persistence for historical tracking\n- Integration with existing test framework\n- Support for selective coverage measurement by module\n\n**Coverage Targets:**\n- Reliable measurement: 100% test runs without coverage errors\n- Reporting frequency: Every test run generates reports\n- Trend analysis: Historical coverage data available\n- Gate effectiveness: Coverage regressions blocked automatically","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T17:00:35.154336Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-11T17:00:35.154336Z"}

This loses fine-grained type information important for research-grade evaluation.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support hierarchical type mapping (66 -\u003e 11 -\u003e fine-grained)\n2. Preserve original benchmark types in entity metadata\n3. Allow flexible remapping between benchmarks\n4. Support custom type hierarchies via configuration\n5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Hierarchical Type System (3 days)\n- Define type hierarchy for all 66 Few-NERD types\n- Create type registry with metadata\n- Implement hierarchical mapping functions\n\n### Phase 2: Flexible Mapper Class (2 days)\n- Create EntityTypeMapper class\n- Add preserve_fine_grained option\n- Support custom hierarchies via config\n\n### Phase 3: Integration (2 days)\n- Update eval_metrics.py to use new mapper\n- Update test_academic_benchmarks.py\n- Add validation tests\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation (1 day)\n- Document type hierarchy\n- Add usage examples\n- Update ENTITY_TYPE_MAPPING.md\n\n## Deliverables\n- tests/benchmarks/type_hierarchy.py - Type hierarchy definitions\n- tests/benchmarks/entity_type_mapper.py - Flexible mapper class\n- Updated evaluation metrics with hierarchy support\n- Documentation of type hierarchy\n- Migration guide for existing code\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 66 Few-NERD types mapped hierarchically\n- Original types preserved in metadata\n- Backward compatibility maintained\n- Type hierarchy documented\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","estimated_minutes":4800,"created_at":"2026-01-30T20:49:06.300666Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-01-30T20:57:28.728351Z","closed_at":"2026-01-30T20:57:28.728351Z","close_reason":"Completed fine-grained entity type mapping: - Created type_hierarchy.py with 66 Few-NERD types in 8 categories - Created EntityTypeMapper class with metadata preservation - Added custom hierarchy and mapping support - Created 19 tests (all passing) - Documented in FINE_GRAINED_MAPPING.md"}
