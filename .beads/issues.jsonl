This loses fine-grained type information important for research-grade evaluation.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support hierarchical type mapping (66 -\u003e 11 -\u003e fine-grained)\n2. Preserve original benchmark types in entity metadata\n3. Allow flexible remapping between benchmarks\n4. Support custom type hierarchies via configuration\n5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Hierarchical Type System (3 days)\n- Define type hierarchy for all 66 Few-NERD types\n- Create type registry with metadata\n- Implement hierarchical mapping functions\n\n### Phase 2: Flexible Mapper Class (2 days)\n- Create EntityTypeMapper class\n- Add preserve_fine_grained option\n- Support custom hierarchies via config\n\n### Phase 3: Integration (2 days)\n- Update eval_metrics.py to use new mapper\n- Update test_academic_benchmarks.py\n- Add validation tests\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation (1 day)\n- Document type hierarchy\n- Add usage examples\n- Update ENTITY_TYPE_MAPPING.md\n\n## Deliverables\n- tests/benchmarks/type_hierarchy.py - Type hierarchy definitions\n- tests/benchmarks/entity_type_mapper.py - Flexible mapper class\n- Updated evaluation metrics with hierarchy support\n- Documentation of type hierarchy\n- Migration guide for existing code\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 66 Few-NERD types mapped hierarchically\n- Original types preserved in metadata\n- Backward compatibility maintained\n- Type hierarchy documented\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","estimated_minutes":4800,"created_at":"2026-01-30T20:49:06.300666Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-01-30T20:57:28.728351Z","closed_at":"2026-01-30T20:57:28.728351Z","close_reason":"Completed fine-grained entity type mapping: - Created type_hierarchy.py with 66 Few-NERD types in 8 categories - Created EntityTypeMapper class with metadata preservation - Added custom hierarchy and mapping support - Created 19 tests (all passing) - Documented in FINE_GRAINED_MAPPING.md"}
