# Task: Reflector Skill Formalization (lightrag-982)

## Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Update the `reflect` skill with standard mission processes, including PFC/RTB analysis, structured debriefing, and automated memory discovery.

### Tasks

- [x] **PFC**: Run Pre-Flight Check and verify current objective.
- [x] **Analyze Skills**: Review existing `SKILL.md` files for consistency and structure.
- [x] **Define Template**: Update `reflect/SKILL.md` with a definitive "Mission Reflection" template aligned with SMP.
- [x] **Enhance Workflow**: Update the `reflect` workflow to explicitly include PFC/RTB diagnostic analysis.
- [x] **Implement Debrief**: Update `enhanced_reflect_system.py` to generate formal "Post-Mission Debrief" reports.
- [x] **Memory Discovery**: Implement robust memory discovery in `reflect_assistant.py`.
- [x] **Verify SMP Alignment**: Ensure the skill aligns with the Standard Mission Protocol.

### Steps

1. [x] Run PFC and identify current objective (`lightrag-982`).
2. [x] Analyze current `reflect` skill and scripts.
3. [x] Review other `SKILL.md` files for structural patterns.
4. [x] Propose updates to `reflect/SKILL.md` with enhanced template and workflow.
5. [x] Implement debrief generation logic in `enhanced_reflect_system.py`.
6. [x] Implement robust keyword/context analysis in `reflect_assistant.py`.
7. [x] Verify everything works by running a test reflection.
8. [x] Perform RTB and final debrief.
