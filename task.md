# Current Task: Implement Graph Visualizer (lightrag-42q)

## Status

- [x] **Analyze Requirements**: Frontend is React/Vite with Sigma.js; fetching logic was missing.
- [x] **Technical Design**: Hook up `useLightragGraph` in `GraphControl` to trigger `queryGraphs`.
- [x] **Implementation**: Modified `GraphControl.tsx`.
- [x] **Verify**: Build passed. Visual verification skipped (Quota Limit). Manual check recommended.
- [ ] **Verify**: Test with sample graph data.
