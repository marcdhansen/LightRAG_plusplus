# Workspace Documentation

This directory contains workspace-specific documentation and resources for agents working on the LightRAG project.

## Files

- **TODO.md** - Current project TODO items and tasks requiring attention
- **legacy_todo.md** - Original TODO file preserved for historical reference

## Purpose

This workspace documentation serves as a centralized location for:

1. **Task Tracking** - Current and outstanding work items
2. **Development Standards** - Coding practices and guidelines
3. **Troubleshooting Guides** - Common issues and solutions
4. **Historical Context** - Previous decisions and legacy information

## Usage

All agents should:
- Review TODO.md before starting new work
- Update documentation when making significant changes
- Follow established patterns and standards
- Preserve historical context when updating files
