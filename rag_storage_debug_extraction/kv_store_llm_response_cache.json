    "original_prompt": "---Task---\nExtract ALL entities and relationships from the input text in YAML format.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Strict YAML Output:** Output only valid YAML. Do not include preamble or thoughts.\n2.  **Completeness:** DO NOT omit entities at the end of the text. Extract EVERYTHING relevant, including abstract concepts or themes mentioned.\n3.  **No Contamination:** Descriptions and keywords must be based ONLY on the provided Input Text. Do NOT copy information from the examples.\n4.  **Entity Mapping:**\n    - name: \"<entity_name>\"\n      type: \"<entity_type>\"\n      description: \"<entity_description>\"\n5.  **Relationship Mapping:**\n    - source: \"<source_entity>\"\n      target: \"<target_entity>\"\n      keywords: \"<keywords>\"\n      description: \"<description>\"\n6.  **Language:** Use English.\n\n<Input Text>\nAlbert Einstein was a famous theoretical physicist born in Ulm, Germany. He is best known for developing the Theory of Relativity.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting ALL relevant entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **ENTITY EXTRACTION (STRICT):**\n    *   Identify ALL meaningful entities including Persons, Locations, Organizations, Events, and **important Concepts** (e.g. \"Theory of Relativity\", \"Universal Healthcare\", \"Social Justice\").\n    *   **CONCEPT RECOGNITION:** Concepts are often abstract nouns representing ideas, philosophies, or major themes.\n    *   Categorize entities using types: Person,Location,Organization,Concept,Theory,Event.\n    *   **CRITICAL:** Do NOT skip entities mentioned at the end of the text.\n    *   **DECOMPOSITION:** Always split compound locations (e.g., \"Paris, France\" -> \"Paris\", \"France\").\n    *   **NO HALLUCINATION:** Strictly use information present in the text. Do NOT add biographical info or external facts. Keywords and Descriptions must come ONLY from the Input Text, NOT the examples.\n    *   **FORMAT:** Every entity MUST have 'name', 'type', and 'description'. Use a list of objects.\n\n2.  **RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION (STRICT):**\n    *   Identify all meaningful relationships between ALL identified entities.\n    *   **DENSE LINKING:** Do not just link to the main subject; link entities to each other if they appear in the same context or relate to each other.\n    *   **FORMAT:** Use 'source', 'target', 'keywords', 'description' in a list of objects.\n    *   **CONSISTENCY:** Use the EXACT same entity names in relationships as defined in the entities list.\n\n3.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n    *   Return ONLY a valid YAML object with 'entities' and 'relationships' keys.\n\n---Examples---\nentities:\n  - name: \"Alex\"\n    type: \"Person\"\n    description: \"Alex is a character who observes the dynamics among other characters.\"\n  - name: \"Taylor\"\n    type: \"Person\"\n    description: \"Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty.\"\nrelationships:\n  - source: \"Alex\"\n    target: \"Taylor\"\n    keywords: \"power dynamics, observation\"\n    description: \"Alex observes Taylor's behavior.\"\n\nentities:\n  - name: \"Charles Darwin\"\n    type: \"Person\"\n    description: \"A British naturalist and biologist known for his contributions to evolution.\"\n  - name: \"Shrewsbury\"\n    type: \"Location\"\n    description: \"The birthplace of Charles Darwin in England.\"\n  - name: \"England\"\n    type: \"Location\"\n    description: \"A country in Europe where Charles Darwin was born.\"\n  - name: \"Theory of Evolution\"\n    type: \"Concept\"\n    description: \"A scientific theory explaining the diversity of life through natural selection.\"\nrelationships:\n  - source: \"Charles Darwin\"\n    target: \"Shrewsbury\"\n    keywords: \"birthplace\"\n    description: \"Charles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, England.\"\n  - source: \"Charles Darwin\"\n    target: \"Theory of Evolution\"\n    keywords: \"development\"\n    description: \"Charles Darwin developed the Theory of Evolution.\"\n  - source: \"Charles Darwin\"\n    target: \"England\"\n    keywords: \"origin, nationality\"\n    description: \"Charles Darwin was a British naturalist from England.\"",
