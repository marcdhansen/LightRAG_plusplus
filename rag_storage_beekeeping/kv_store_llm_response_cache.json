To enhance the query with higher-order relatedness,\nLightRAGfurther gathers neighboring nodes within the local subgraphs of the retrieved graph\nelements. This process involves the set {vi|vi ∈ V ∧(vi ∈ Nv ∨ vi ∈ Ne)}, where Nv and Ne\nrepresent the one-hop neighboring nodes of the retrieved nodes v and edges e, respectively.\nThis dual-level retrieval paradigm not only facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and relations\nthrough keyword matching, but also enhances the comprehensiveness of results by integrating relevant\nstructural information from the constructed knowledge graph.\n3.3 R ETRIEVAL -AUGMENTED ANSWER GENERATION\nUtilization of Retrieved Information. Utilizing the retrieved information ψ(q; ˆD), our LightRAG\nemploys a general-purpose LLM to generate answers based on the collected data. This data comprises\nconcatenated values V from relevant entities and relations, produced by the profiling function P(·). It\nincludes names, descriptions of entities and relations, and excerpts from the original text.\nContext Integration and Answer Generation. By unifying the query with this multi-source text,\nthe LLM generates informative answers tailored to the user’s needs, ensuring alignment with the\nquery’s intent. This approach streamlines the answer generation process by integrating both context\nand query into the LLM model, as illustrated in detailed examples (Appendix 7.2).\n3.4 C OMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF THE LIGHT RAG F RAMEWORK\nIn this section, we analyze the complexity of our proposed LightRAG framework, which can be\ndivided into two main parts. The first part is the graph-based Index phase. During this phase, we use\nthe large language model (LLM) to extract entities and relationships from each chunk of text. As\na result, the LLM needs to be called total tokens\nchunk size times. Importantly, there is no additional overhead\ninvolved in this process, making our approach highly efficient in managing updates to new text.\nThe second part of the process involves the graph-based retrieval phase. For each query, we first\nutilize the large language model (LLM) to generate relevant keywords. Similar to current Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) systems Gao et al. (2023; 2022); Chan et al. (2024), our retrieval\nmechanism relies on vector-based search. However, instead of retrieving chunks as in conventional\nRAG, we concentrate on retrieving entities and relationships. This approach markedly reduces\nretrieval overhead compared to the community-based traversal method used in GraphRAG.\n4 E VALUATION\nWe conduct empirical evaluations on benchmark data to assess the effectiveness of the proposed\nLightRAG framework by addressing the following research questions:• (RQ1): How does LightRAG\ncompare to existing RAG baseline methods in terms of generation performance? • (RQ2): How do\ndual-level retrieval and graph-based indexing enhance the generation quality of LightRAG? • (RQ3):\nWhat specific advantages does LightRAG demonstrate through case examples in various scenarios? •\n(RQ4): What are the costs associated with LightRAG, as well as its adaptability to data changes?\n4.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETTINGS\nEvaluation Datasets. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of LightRAG, we selected four datasets\nfrom the UltraDomain benchmark (Qian et al., 2024). The UltraDomain data is sourced from 428\ncollege textbooks and encompasses 18 distinct domains, including agriculture, social sciences, and\nhumanities. From these, we chose the Agriculture, CS, Legal, and Mix datasets. Each dataset contains\nbetween 600,000 and 5,000,000 tokens, with detailed information provided in Table 4. Below is a\nspecific introduction to the four domains utilized in our experiments:\n• Agriculture: This domain focuses on agricultural practices, covering a range of topics including\nbeekeeping, hive management, crop production, and disease prevention.\n• CS: This domain focuses on computer science and encompasses key areas of data science and\nsoftware engineering.

They also monitor the amount of pollen available for bees to eat, as this affects their ability to produce honey.\n\n- Preventing pest infestations: To keep their hives safe from diseases and pests, beekeepers use a variety of methods, such as using smoke to calm bees and applying neonicotinoids or other pesticides. They also regularly inspect the hive for signs of pests and remove any that they find.\n\n- Utilizing techniques to handle bees: To manage their hives effectively, beekeepers may employ techniques such as dividing the hive into smaller subhives, replacing damaged hives, and using advanced technologies like drones to monitor and control hive operations.",
