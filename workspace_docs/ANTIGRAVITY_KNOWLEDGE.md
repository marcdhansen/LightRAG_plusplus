## What is a Knowledge Item?

A Knowledge Item is a collection of related information on a specific topic. Each Knowledge Item contains a title and summary describing what it covers, and a collection of artifacts providing information on the topic. Possible examples of artifacts include automatically generated documentation, code examples, or persistent memories of user instructions.

## How are Knowledge Items Generated?

As you interact with the agent, Antigravity automatically analyzes and extracts information from your conversation and uses that information to create new KIs or update existing KIs.

## How are Knowledge Items used by the Agent?

The summaries of all your Knowledge Items are available to the agent, which uses them to inform its responses. When the agent identifies a Knowledge Item that is relevant to the conversation, it will automatically study the artifacts in that Knowledge Item and use the applicable information.
